# Papers Read

I'm trying to document all the papers I have read. Trying to capture my reading journey and enable quick looking up of my reflections on a particular paper, I choose to store my reflections of papers under the directory of the time I have first read them. Exceptional readings like _The Dream of Red Chamber_ will be constant in space and shouldn't be a big problem...

Currently exploring ways to read and document my reading process for easy looking up of papers I have read and I'm reading which papers at certain times.
