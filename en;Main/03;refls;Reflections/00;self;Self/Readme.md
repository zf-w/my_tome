# Self Reflection

I think it's a good opportunity to reflect on myself since I'm trying to apply for PhD programs.

I'm reading Mor Harchol-Balter's article _Applying to Ph.D. Programs in Computer Science_ ([link (last accessed: y2024m11d02)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)). I think it might be helpful if I can write things out along with the reading process.

## Ph.D. Frustrations

### Loneliness

According to the article, one major source of frustration comes from loneliness. I'm very good at handling loneliness. That's basically what I built this website for. I talk to this website and the background codes more than almost everyone else. I can say that I thrive with loneliness. I can't say I like it, but it's indeed the case.

### People Beat Me to Solution

I'm okay with "someone else beat me to the solution". Having a chance to peek at the beauty of a design, research, or natural laws and theories (including the humanity side) is more important to me than "impact on the field" or "authority of an area". As long as I can replicate and see for myself the beauty within the others' solution, I'm good with it. That's why Computer Science is preferable to me: even if I can't understand others' solutions, I should be able to reproduce their solution, given that they have proper documentation.

## Ph.D. Joys

I enjoy the "joy of truly understanding". I truly wish I'd have a chance to bring a research problem "as far as I want and understand everything about it." On the other hand, I typically do not greatly enjoy "making an impact" or "being the authority on an area" unless the impact is truly and directly helpful to other people.

## Ph.D. Personality

> A Ph.D. requires a particular type of personality. You need to be someone
> who is obsessed with figuring out a problem. You need to have tremendous
> perseverance and be capable of hard work. You need to be willing to do
> whatever it takes to solve your problem (e.g., take 5 math classes, learn a
> whole new area like databases, rewrite the whole kernel, etc.)

I have tried a bunch of popular web-development frameworks and finally reached the goal of writing the website with vanilla JavaScript. There are some small parts relating to the other's design, like parsing Markdown and rendering 3D scenes with Web GPU, but in general, I'm able to control almost everything on my website. I'm definitely willing to take everything to solve my problem.

## Expressing Myself

> ...you need to be able to express yourself...

I'm not sure whether I'm able to express myself. So I'm designing this website to help me. Hopefully, this can help.
