# April

# April 5th, Saturday

I got a little bit distracted when pressing the "Continue" button on the "Card Payment only (No Cash Payment)" page and forgot to scan the "Pure Life" water. I found that out after double checking the receipt and returned back to the end of queue to check the water out.

I’m sorry if I caused any confusion or inconvenience—to the other customers watching me, the shop assistant, the recognition algorithm, or the security camera operator.

# April 3rd, Thursday

My groupmate and I encountered a visiting family in the elevator. I wasn't expecting them to ask me about the iSchool. I hesitated for about two seconds, and the daughter said something like "_You can say anything._" I responded, "_It's a pretty good program. It covers both the technical and social sides of knowledge._"

The father (I assume) then asked me what year I'm in. I didn't catch the question right away and stared at him for about a second, calculating what kind of response might best support the chances of the daughter (I assume) accepting an offer from the school. The daughter noticed my hesitation, realized I hadn't understood the question, and kindly repeated it. I then replied, "_Senior._"

By that time, the elevator reached the fourth floor. They said "_thank you_," and I echoed back, "_Thank you, have a good day._"

I thank the daughter for catching my hesitation and relieving the awkwardness.

I'm sorry if I have caused any misunderstanding, created an unpleasant moment for the family, or created a bad image for the School of Information Science of UIUC.
