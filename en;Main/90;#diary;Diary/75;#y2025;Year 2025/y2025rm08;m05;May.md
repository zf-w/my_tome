# May 2025

May is mostly about CS498 final project, CS341 Final Exam, graduation, and a short trip with my parents.

## CS498 Final Project

Teamwork always ends up with the most responsible person taking up all the work. The good thing about CS498's final project is that at least one team member is willing to handle the slides and the presentation.

## CS341 Final Exam

The exam was really creative. I'm glad that I can get all the credits, considering I talk to computers way more than I talk to any other carbon-based lifeforms.

## Graduation

I'm not a big fan of graduations.

## Trip

Nothing interesting except that I got three pocketbooks, two _The Declaration of Independence + The Consitituion_ and one _George Washington's Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation_.

I met a guy who claimed to be an alumnus of UIUC outside Battery Park in New York. He said he had played basketball at UIUC, and he saw my hat and got all the memories back. We had a short conversation about Green Street, even though I'm not sure which building he was talking about. I haven't been to a lot of places around the campus. We fist-bumped three times hahaha. I hope I was being polite all the time since I'm not familiar with this kind of conversation. I'm sorry if I accidentally said anything impolite.
