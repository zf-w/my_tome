# Februray 28th

Documented this month's Leetcode mini problems.

# February 26th

The MP 'malloc' went smoother than I thought!

# Februray 24th

The board game experiment project went smoother than I thought. Everything worked as I planned.

# February 18th

Today, I went to County Market to buy some groceries, including Essential EVERYDAY's Cranberry Chocolate Nut Trail Mix (I think it's a new type) ($5.29), Wlide Protein Chips Waffle Flavor ($3.69), PraireFarm Sweet Iced Tea ($2.49), and Chop House Smashed Burger ($14.89).

When I was going to check out, I suddenly found that my cell phone was missing. The nice cashier helped me to save the "basket" for me. After crossing the road, I remembered that my phone was in another pocket, an unusual one. I quickly returned to the store, checked out, and thanked the cashier.

Thanks again to the kind cashier for saving me in such an awkward moment.

# mp:shell:part2

Amazing! I got passed the testcases without any twists or bumps!

In recent days, LeetCode's daily questions have been about recursion. I was just wondering what the official name for "daily questions" is, whether they are called problems or questions. Funny, they are called daily questions on the webpage but are also called problems inside the web URL.

# February 13th

For the past several days, I have been mainly working on CS341's MP Shell (including Leetcode daily problems). The experience was great. But it can be a little sad when I can't learn which part went wrong (but, luckily, I guess such things will never happen if you are just developing your own stuff.)

I'm slowly redesigning how I keep track of the mini-problems I solved.

I'm planning to make a "sorry_and_thx" and "worldview" pages.

Several days ago, in County Market, I noticed that some careful people rearranged all the items on the shelf. I deeply appreciate their efforts.

# February 12th

Yeah! Snow!

# February 10th

Today, I have done a lot of clean-ups. I wiped the stove and the kitchen table, shaved my hair, etc.

One interesting bug I have encountered was the End-of-File. When I was reading the documentation, I wondered why there is an extra "s" character before the `size_t` (`ssize_t`). Later, when I was trying to check whether there is such a character inside the read C string from the `getline`, I noticed that the "read length" became the hexadecimal "ffffff....ffff". After further checking documentation about the End-Of-File, I suddenly realized that the weird number is just "-1". So that's what the extra "s" means (or maybe I'm wrong again, and that's not about "signed"). I'm grateful that I, for some reason, tried to print out the "read length."
