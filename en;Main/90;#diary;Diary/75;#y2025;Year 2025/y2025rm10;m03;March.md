# March

The beginning of March is mainly about the "Machine Problem" of "uiuc/cs341": "malloc". Prof. Angrave says it's a MP that can turn a student into a new person. It's quite true that the memory bugs are often quite subtle, and oftentime it takes sometime for the bug to reveal in novel and unexpected ways. I would say my experience writing the MP is quite good and, maybe, even less difficult than the previous MP "shell."

I do sometimes feel that the starting "intuition" or "heuristic" of design is quite important. A good heuristic helps solve edge cases.

My friend and I went to Texas Road House for dinner. I brought my own bag for leftovers. After I returned, I noticed that some sauces leaked outside the container, and there was a stain on the bottom side of my bag. I probably should have used the plastic bag provided. I'm sorry if this might cause trouble for the taxi driver. I hope everything will be fine. Sorry again.

I deeply appreciate the waitress's patience, and I thank her for a warm drawing of a smiling face and "thank you!" on the receipt.

I went to McDonald's to pick up some burgers. I'm sincerely thankful to the cashier. She replied to my "Thank you. Have a good day." with "Thank you very much." The whole dialogue was "... Have a good day", "Thank you. Have a good day", and "Thank you very much".

I got rejected by UIUC's CS Ph.D. program.

I'm sorry that I forgot to return my shopping basket after checking out.

Chore works are also about datastructures. I might need to think more about what's on the heap and what's on the stack. Recently, I'm trying to put food packages of similar shape, material, and size into one batch.

I have been playing Kingdom Come II for a while. I enjoyed the word choice of "parted," like "you parted with your 500 coins." I would say, in function naming, "part" might be a better choice compared with "drop," "delete," and "destroy." Furthermore, compared with "free," "parted" is kind of more putting the programmer and the "object" on the same "level." I would love to define such things as `void linked_list_part_with_it(LinkedList* linked_list_ptr)`.
