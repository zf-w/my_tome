# June 2025

This month is about parting with my old apartment and cleaning my roommates' forgotten stuff and mine, physically, mentally, and digitally.

## June 16th

I thanked a guy for holding a door for me at the bookstore.

A senior lady asked me about a building's location. I didn't catch the building's name that she asked for, and I think I don't know where the building is. I said I was sorry, and she replied, "ok."

I didn't reply to the restaurant clerk's "Have a nice day" because I was a little bit far away, and my decision-making process about the "appropriate reply time and distance window" took me too much time. Sorry.

In my apartment elevator, I let a guy go out of the elevator first, and he held a door for me later. I thanked him.

## June 9th

I have redesigned and re-implemented my previous "Caligraphy Graph Wallpaper" project. It's pretty surprising to see how the CS341 "heuristics" help redesign the project workflow and codes.
