## May 2024: Personal Website III

I have been dreaming about making my own static website generator and learning full-stack web development in depth. Next.js was pretty good, but I do feel it's not ideal for constantly adding new gadgets and rendering Markdown files into static sites. Anyway, the summer break is a good opportunity for me to think about the underlying structures of my website, relationships between pages, and importation between JavaScript files. Knowing the origination and purpose of every byte of my website (as much as possible) is very rewarding. Currently, in my understanding, except those from the "three.js" library, all bytes sent to the client browser are by my design.

## May 2024: Visualizing Connect Four

Visualizing the Connect Four game graph. There are many more tricky parts than what meets the eye.

## May 2024: Making a Barnes Hut Tree Rust crate

Learning to write and publish my first open-source project. The project is for accelerating the n-body force calculation for force-directed graph layout algorithm.

```json#graph
{
    "load": ["/src/assets/bht/airfoil1.bht.test.json"],
    "camera_param": {
        "z": 2.0
    }
}
```
