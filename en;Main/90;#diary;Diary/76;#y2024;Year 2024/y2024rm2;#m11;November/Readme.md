# November

## Music of the Month

1. _We Are the World_

   "We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving."

2. _明天会更好_

   "让我拥抱你的梦, 让我拥有你真心的面孔."

   Actually, this line is fairly related to my research interest.

## Note

This will be a stressful month in many ways.

It is such a long month. Many things happened this month.

For my personal development, I managed to fulfill my vision of fully customized deployment of my server with user authentication, hopefully, secure enough. I need to enter four passwords to kick off the server, and that number will continue to grow depending on the private sections of my tome. Oh nature, I love my tome.

For my academic journey, although I'm anticipating a dead end, I find out that's the thing I've been looking for the whole time: I want to learn, feel, and explore people's minds and personalities or say strategies through long enough readings. The lengths of academic journals are not something you can find on Instagram or Twitter. I guess, though, the "privileged bias" or condescending sense is still strong for a bunch of papers. But I would say that's interesting enough.

For the tome-writing patterns, I have found an interesting way to document my readings: just store reflections in the directory entry of the week I first started to read and use a pointer mapping its name to that week. I guess this way is both human and computer-friendly enough.
