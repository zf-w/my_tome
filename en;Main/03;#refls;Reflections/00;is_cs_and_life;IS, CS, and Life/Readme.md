# CS and Life

I feel that Computer Science is not only a "science about computers" or "how to repair computers" but also a lifestyle, a type of personality. Emm... I guess, in some sense, every field, or even every tool, is shaping people's heuristics in problem-solving and daily lives. But I guess I'm resonating with Computer Science more, plus the Chinese literature of _The Dream of Red Chambers_.

I currently can only think of a few topics. I will gradually add to this topic.

## Social Data Structures

Data Structures are more common than you might think...? For example, maybe we can say that the social design of "family name" is, to some extent, a Union Find structure of Y chromosomes. I would personally suggest people give their children a family name, concatenating the first name of the parents in the order of the younger name first. My design is simply aiming at quickly finding one's parent, instead of the origin of the Y chromosome, given that the first names are something that can almost instantly uniquely identify persons, e.g., my design (also the common design) surely won't work if everybody assigns their children the same first name.

## Credit Assigning Problem

I think this is a classic problem in Reinforcement Learning. Even though the real-world rewards are definitely not scalar, i.e., maybe a grade on your exam paper is scalar, the instructor's face when passing that paper to you might not be scalar.

The world is cruel in a way that each individual doesn't have enough chance to practice and trial and error. Imagine you eat something you never tried before an exam, which you have zero prior estimates of, and you get a bad result. Do you blame the new cuisine?

## Item Organization

When you put items in your pocket or drawers in your room, which items do you want to have access to as quickly as possible?

How do you arrange your dishes? Stack or queue?
