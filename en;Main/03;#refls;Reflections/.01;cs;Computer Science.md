# Reflections on Computer Science

Even though many people might see computers as something inhuman, standing on the opposite side of core human values like love or emotion, I don't see computers in these ways.
I feel that computer science itself is already very interdisciplinary. It balances humanity and technology, theory and application, abstract and concrete very well.
I personally feel computer science is a science of being considerate. To make good algorithms, programs, and software, you need to be considerate of (1) natural and mathematical laws, (2) compilers and interpreters, (3) hardware (e.g., memories, caches), (4) other developers, and (5) end users.
