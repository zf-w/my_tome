# Reflections on Loss Adjustment

> Suicide is not a bad word. What's bad is our refusal as a society to talk openly and plainly about it. As adults, teachers, parents, colleagues, classmates we have a responsibility to those around us, especially those who are young, those still trying to make sense of the world. (Haresh Sharma, Cultural Medallion Recipient and Resident Playwright of the Necessary Stage)

Sigh. I'm worried that perhaps only a society that refuses to talk openly and plainly about suicide can "thrive" and survive. Maybe we don't have the courage and bravery to talk about suicide as a society by sacrificing, suppose, "economy" or "strength." Perhaps the society that values loving, caring, and being considerate had already been extinct or "murdered" by "us."
