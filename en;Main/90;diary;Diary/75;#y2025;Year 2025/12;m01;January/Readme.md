## Block Chain and Society First Class

My self-introduction in class was a bit awkward. I didn't correctly calculate the order of the queue. I thought it was a "double-layer loop" type of sequence, that is, starting from the person at the easternmost end of each row, but it turned out to be a "snake sequence". As a result, I "collided" with the students on the west side. After I said, "Hello, everyone," I realized this and quickly said "sorry" and sat down. I apologized to that classmate here.

Then I said it a bit awkwardly. Now I recall at night, I roughly said (according to the requirements on the PPT, it may be a bit weird), "Hello, everyone. My name is Zhifeng. I'm from China. I have general knowledge of blockchain." I was a bit disconnected when I said it, and I don't remember what everyone responded. After I finished speaking, I nodded and sat down.

I'm sorry that, when I was getting out of the classroom, I waited for the student next to me to pack up and leave, expecting I would follow him. Unexpectedly, he suddenly said "Sorry" and made way. I was confused for a while and didn't say, "No worries." I'm sorry.

After I came back, a friend recommended a CS course to me. I think it is quite in line with my interests. It is also relatively hardcore from the perspective of coding, but it conflicts with the blockchain course. After struggling for a while, I decided to change the course. I am sorry. I actually like to look at technology from a humanistic perspective, but I really hope to experience it while mastering technology.

## Seeing code file as a "Cache Block"

I'm exploring how to set up a project structure that is easy for human developers to follow. Perhaps the project directory structure is also a "data structure" that should be designed in a way that allows human developers to quickly find and loop up the codes for some features. Perhaps a code file can be seen as a cache block that loads together. Then, how to group codes and guess other developers' heuristics is important. For example, putting the license file in the project's root directory is kind of a convention.

This date format is not "cache" friendly haha. If there is a cache of dates, it will group all Thursdays together haha.

## Personal Learning

I'm finally understanding how TLS processes work and how to use the Rust-Lang "ring" crate. For me, it's a little bit unusual to see passing "algorithms" in arguments, but I guess that is what the library developers had to keep in mind when designing this library: the TLS process might choose to use different cipher suites, and that's a runtime decision instead of compile time. I deeply appreciate the design and think I'm learning a lot from it.
