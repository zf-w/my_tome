# Daily Learning

## Thursday, November 13th

One of the biggest challenges in my recent learning would be the disambiguating parsing part from CS421 Programming Languages and Compilers. In my current understanding, disambiguating the parsing process is about carefully designing the grammar tree to ensure clarity. For example, when parsing "1 _ 2 _ 3", by ensuring that a "\*" operator can only have an immediate "\*" subtree on its left, we can ensure the multiplication operator's left-associative property. Now, I'm struggling with how to parse things like `2 \* if x = true then 1 else -1 + 3`. I'm currently forbidding the end expression of a multiplier's right "if" statement to include lower precedence operators to avoid shift-reduce conflicts. But I guess that is not the desired behavior...

## Thursday, November 6th

Today's learning was mainly focusing on parsing algorithms and page table mechanisms in virtualized systems.

I'm thinking about the best ways to document past assignments in my learning journey. Reviewing CS341 and CS225, I noticed there were indeed many week-long thoughtful and playful assignments. I'm grateful to the instructors for developing these well-designed Machine Problems that helped solidify our learning.

## Tuesday, November 4th

One main theme for today was reviewing CS440 Quiz 5 (Neural Networks and Word To Vector) and reading "_Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting_" and "_Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings_". I'm grateful for Prof. Fleck’s efforts in highlighting issues of humanity, justice, and fairness within the field of computer science.
