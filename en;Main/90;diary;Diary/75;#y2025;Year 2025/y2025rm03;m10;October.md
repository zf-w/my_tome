# Friday, October 10th

I finally have some time to review and clean my previous diary entries. I'm always hoping that I can somehow document my journey of learning. On the one hand, I can use this chance to write something, note something, and probably reduce some overthinking. On the other hand, I can probably use this chance to make my journey of learning computer science more transparent, in the hope that it might help the others with a similar interest. Even though I guess my learning journey, or say, work-life balance is not normal, I guess these records can still be interesting for some readers, perhaps future archeologists.

When I was reviewing my old diary entries, I realized that I had already been writing in the very style I'm now hoping to adopt. It's just that I didn't manage to keep the habit going. Now, I have learned more about operating systems, file systems, etc. I think I might be able to maintain the habit this time.
