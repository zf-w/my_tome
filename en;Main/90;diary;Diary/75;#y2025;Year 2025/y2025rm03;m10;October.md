# Wednesday, October 15th

During lunch, I noticed a girl who seemed unsure where to return her tray and left it on the table. I returned it for her, feeling grateful to the person who helped me the first time I visited the restaurant. Later, though, I wondered if I might have been blocking her view of the return cart.

# Tuesday, October 14th

Today's "CS421 Programming Languages and Compilers" lecture was about type derivation theories and algorithms.

Through out today's "CS423 Operating Systems Design" lecture, I have learned and reviewed concepts about page tables and radix trees.

I have taken the Sexual Misconduct Prevention Training program for graduate students at UIUC today.

> # What is a "good" relationship?
>
> Our values influence our relationships. Most of us seek out and want "good" relationships - with family, friends, colleagues, and in dating or more intimate relationships and partnerships. But what exactly is a "good" relationship?
>
> - Honesty: being truthful, genuine, and sincere in your words and actions.
> - Individuality: valuing the things that make us unique, including encouraging one another to pursue professional goals, explore personal interests, and spend time with friends.
> - Respect: accepting someone for who they are and what they stand for, including their boundaries.
> - Trust: having confidence in someone; feeling physically and emotionally safe with them.
> - Communication: exchanging thoughts and ideas in an honest and open manner; speaking up for yourself while respecting the right of others to do the same.
> - Maturity: staying calm and thinking clearly in difficult situations; being open-minded and accepting constructive criticism; taking responsibility, and accountability for individual actions.

## Room showing

The apartment office has arranged a room showing for prospective residents. I'm grateful that the staff asked about my preference for footwear before entering the room. I'm thankful for the respectful gesture.

# Friday, October 10th

I finally have some time to review and clean my previous diary entries. I'm always hoping that I can somehow document my journey of learning. On the one hand, I can use this chance to write something, note something, and probably reduce some overthinking. On the other hand, I can probably use this chance to make my journey of learning computer science more transparent, in the hope that it might help the others with a similar interest. Even though I guess my learning journey, or say, work-life balance is not normal, I guess these records can still be interesting for some readers, perhaps future archeologists.

When I was reviewing my old diary entries, I realized that I had already been writing in the very style I'm now hoping to adopt. It's just that I didn't manage to keep the habit going. Now, I have learned more about operating systems, file systems, etc. I think I might be able to maintain the habit this time.
