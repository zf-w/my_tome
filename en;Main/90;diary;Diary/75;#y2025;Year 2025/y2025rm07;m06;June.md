# June 2025

This month is about parting with my old apartment and cleaning my roommates' forgotten stuff and mine, physically, mentally, and digitally.

# Sunday, June 29th

When I'm checking out my groceries at Target Campustown after dusk, the checkout assistant kindly noticed me that clicking the "using my own bag" button can get me some discounts. I thanked her and wished her a good night before parting.

# Monday, June 16th

I thanked a guy for holding a door for me at the bookstore.

A senior lady asked me about a building's location. I didn't catch the building's name that she asked for, and I think I don't know where the building is. I said I was sorry, and she replied, "ok."

I didn't reply to the restaurant clerk's "Have a nice day" because I was a little bit far away, and my decision-making process about the "appropriate reply time and distance window" took me too much time. Sorry.

In my apartment elevator, I let a guy go out of the elevator first, and he held a door for me later. I thanked him.

# Monday, June 9th

I have redesigned and re-implemented my previous "Caligraphy Graph Wallpaper" project. It's pretty surprising to see how the CS341 "heuristics" help redesign the project workflow and codes.
