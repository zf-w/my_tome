# Year 2026

2026 seems to be a year of disturbance.

## January

In January, I was mainly focusing on learning to cook with a ChefIq cooker and on finding and understanding various ingredients from local supermarkets. I have also learned various ways to handle ingredients, such as how to peel and dice shallots. There is something in common between cooking and computer programming. If I need to use one phrase to describe it, the phrase might be "being considerate". I need to understand different ingredients and steps, just like how I tend to understand different developers' designs at different levels of abstraction.

During house cleaning, I also learned a lot about recycling by reading Urbana's recycling webpage.
