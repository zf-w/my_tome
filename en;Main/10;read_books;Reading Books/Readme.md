# Reading Books

I guess it would be good practice for me to document the books and papers I have read and studied, especially those I tried to reproduce and replicate their results.

## My Favorite: _Dream Of The Red Chamber_

- Xue-Qin(Snow Celery) Cao. (18th century). _Dream Of The Red Chamber_.
