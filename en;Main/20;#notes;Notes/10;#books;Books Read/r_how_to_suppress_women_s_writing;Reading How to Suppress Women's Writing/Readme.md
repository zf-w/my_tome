> "I am worried that new readers of this book will mostly see themselves as the suppressed and not the suppressors - that they will refuse to see their own unconscious biases and the forms they take, such as turning up their noses at a Caribbean writer, for example, for being too localized and not universal enough, or that they will refuse to read a queer writer because 'it is just not my taste, you know?'" (around the end of Foreword by Jessa Crispin)

Sigh... I'm worried that..., to some extent, "tit-for-tat," the equivalent of retaliation, is an overly universal strategy... I currently (y2025m01d21) think that it's ok for females and all suppressed marginalized groups to "bias back", and the suppressors should take it and not "retaliate" back. But... I'm worried if that's possible.
