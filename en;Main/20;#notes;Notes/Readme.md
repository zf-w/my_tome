# Notes

The notes section is more about my relationship with other people, ideas, and the world.

## Best Novel

I would say Xue-Qin Cao (曹雪芹)'s _Dream of the Red Chamber/Mansion/Abbey_ (_红楼梦_) is my favorite; the best book that I find aligning with my own concerns, personalities, and goals. The author's comprehensive observations of the world, people's personalities and dynamics, and his philosophy deeply touched me.

## Best College-level Courses

I enjoyed the IS department's courses concerning people's relationship with technologies and the CS and STAT's hardcore courses, which touched on the most fundamental knowledge of Computer Science and Statistics. I enjoyed the _Independent Study_ with Prof. Chin, which allowed me to explore my research interests, and the _Data Visualization_ by Prof. Naiman, which inspired me to build my own website with abundant visualizations (even though they are not the traditional ones).

My favorite courses are Prof. David Dubin's courses: _Social History of Game and Gaming_, _Computing in Humanities_, and _Decision Analysis and Modeling_. I particularly enjoyed the professor's efforts connecting the normative technological things and the descriptive humanity things.
