## Socket and React

I need to take some time to carefully think about how the server should update the React page's states with the web socket...

## Leetcode Daily 2070. Day 827

## Chat Signature

I think the digital fingerprint concept might help the instantaneous information-sharing process of social deception games like Blood on the Clock Tower. It's currently added under the "utilites" directory. A main effort made into this is not the implementation, but how to compose texts to explain my idea. I'm grateful that my current design allows me to effortlessly embeded various gadgets into texts.

## Cache Simulator

The current topic of CS233 is caching. I understand that we are supposed to get a good understanding of how different coding practices will affect the performance from a hardware stand point, but manually calculating the cache misses can be a little... inconvenient, especially when under time or other pressure. I would hope my future supervisors or bosses will not pick me during a meeting and ask me what's the approximate number of cache miss of some Intel chip of given this program.

```python
class CacheSim:
    def __init__(self, way_size, idx_bits_num, off_bits_num):
        self.way_size = way_size
        self.idx_size = 1 << idx_bits_num
        self.off_size = 1 << off_bits_num
        self.__data = [[] for i in range(self.idx_size)]
        self.__total_access_num = 0
        self.__total_miss_num = 0

    def get_tag_and_idx_from_addr(self, addr):
        return (int(addr / (self.off_size * self.idx_size)), int(addr / self.off_size) % self.idx_size)

    def load_addr(self, addr):
        self.__total_access_num += 1
        tag, idx = self.get_tag_and_idx_from_addr(addr)
        way_list = self.__data[idx]
        for prev_tag_i, prev_tag in enumerate(iter(way_list)):
            if prev_tag == tag:
                way_list.pop(prev_tag_i)
                way_list.insert(0, tag) # Bug here, was `insert(tag, 0)`
                return;
        self.__total_miss_num += 1;
        if len(way_list) >= self.way_size:
            way_list.pop(-1)
        way_list.append(tag)


    def get_access_num(self):
        return self.__total_access_num
    def get_miss_num(self):
        return self.__total_miss_num
```

## Leetcode Daily 2563. Day 829

I'm grateful that the calculation of the final indices of Binary Searches below didn't cause off-by-one errors. I haven't had time to carefully think about those, but they indeed worked. I'm very grateful.

```rust
/// ## Leetcode 2563. Count the Number of Fair Pairs
/// https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/
/// - `Medium`; `Independently Solved`; `y2024m11d14`;
///
/// I guess this might be quicker if we consider the duplication of pairs. Maybe the begin and end indices can be further "pruned".
pub fn count_fair_pairs(mut nums: Vec<i32>, lower: i32, upper: i32) -> i64 {
    // [0,1,4,4,5,7]
    // [1,2,5,5,6,8]
    // [4,5,8,8,9,11]
    // [4,5,8,8,9,11]
    // [5,6,9,9,10,11]
    // [7,8,11,11,12,14]
    nums.sort_unstable();
    let len = nums.len();
    let mut ans_count: usize = 0;
    let mut prev_lower_i = len;
    let mut prev_upper_i = len;
    for num_ref in nums.iter() {
        let curr_lower = lower - num_ref;
        let curr_upper = upper - num_ref;
        let mut begin_i = 0;
        let mut end_i = prev_lower_i;
        while begin_i < end_i {
            let mid_i = (begin_i + end_i) / 2;
            if nums[mid_i] >= curr_lower {
                end_i = mid_i;
            } else {
                begin_i = mid_i + 1;
            }
        }
        let lower_i = begin_i;
        prev_lower_i = lower_i;
        let mut begin_i = prev_lower_i;
        let mut end_i = prev_upper_i;

        while begin_i < end_i {
            let mid_i = (begin_i + end_i) / 2;
            if nums[mid_i] > curr_upper {
                end_i = mid_i;
            } else {
                begin_i = mid_i + 1;
            }
        }
        let upper_i = begin_i;
        prev_upper_i = upper_i;
        ans_count += upper_i - lower_i;
        let num_square = num_ref + num_ref;
        if num_square >= lower && num_square <= upper {
            ans_count -= 1;
        }
    }
    ans_count as i64 / 2
}
```
