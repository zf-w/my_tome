## Personal Study

### Documenting Courses

I spent some time documenting all the courses I have taken. I think it's very important to say thank you to all the instructors in a fairly more permanent way. And it's also important to make my study life more transparent, though nobody asks.

On the other hand, even though I only had an extremely limited number of "coffee chats" with my peer classmates before, I would say this class list should be able to shorten much of the conversation. In my understanding, "coffee chat" should not be only about what courses you have taken. (Sigh) I guess it would be much harder to understand a person outside those social constructs.

## Leetcode Daily 3133. Day 825

This is an interesting problem. It took me a while to realize that I can think about it from the angle of permutations: only zero digits in `x` can be changed to ones. These days, the problems are all related to bit-calculation. I'm indeed very busy these days. These days, I can always come up with an idea when I am just about to open and copy from solutions. I guess this can't last long, but maybe it's a hint of my current situation.

```rust
pub fn min_end(n: i32, mut x: i32) -> i64 {
    let n_i64 = n as i64 - 1;
    let x_i64 = x as i64;
    let mut zero_idxs: [usize; 32] = [0;32];
    let mut zero_len: usize = 0;
    let mut zero_i: usize = 0;
    let mut big_shift_num_i64: i64 = 1;
    while x > 0 {
        if x & 1 == 0 {
            zero_idxs[zero_len] = zero_i;
            big_shift_num_i64 += 1 << zero_i;
            zero_len += 1;
            // println!("{}", zero_i);
        }
        // println!("x: {}", x);
        zero_i += 1;
        x >>= 1;
    }
    let to_big_shift_len_i64: i64 = 1 << zero_len;
    // println!("{:b}, {}, {}, {}", x_i64, to_big_shift_len_i64, (n_i64 / to_big_shift_len_i64 ) * (x_i64 + big_shift_num_i64), big_shift_num_i64);
    let mut ans_i64: i64 = x_i64 + (n_i64 / to_big_shift_len_i64) * (x_i64 + big_shift_num_i64);
    let mut to_add_i64 = n_i64 % to_big_shift_len_i64;
    zero_i = 0;
    while to_add_i64 > 0 {
        if to_add_i64 & 1 == 1{
            ans_i64 += 1 << zero_idxs[zero_i];
            // println!("{}, {}", zero_i, zero_idxs[zero_i]);
        }
        to_add_i64 >>= 1;
        zero_i += 1;
    }
    ans_i64
}
// 5,7,13
```

# Sunday, Nov 10th

I'm grateful that I got the `Execution Time - Everything` correct in the practice exam on the first attempt. That's the first time I met a "break if i <= 800", i.e., "loop 801 times", case, which creates a lot for fractional cycles.
