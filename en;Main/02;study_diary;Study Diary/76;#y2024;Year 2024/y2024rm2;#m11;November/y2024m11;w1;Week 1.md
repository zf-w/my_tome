## Personal Study

### Documenting Courses

I spent some time documenting all the courses I have taken. I think it's very important to say thank you to all the instructors in a fairly more permanent way. And it's also important to make my study life more transparent, though nobody asks.

On the other hand, even though I only had an extremely limited number of "coffee chats" with my peer classmates before, I would say this class list should be able to shorten much of the conversation. In my understanding, "coffee chat" should not be only about what courses you have taken. (Sigh) I guess it would be much harder to understand a person outside those social constructs.
