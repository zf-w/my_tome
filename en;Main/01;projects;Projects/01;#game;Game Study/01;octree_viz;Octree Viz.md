# Octree Viz

I have been planning for a long time to use the Octree data structure to fairly accurately and quickly select 3D elements and view information.

```json#con4_bhtree
{
    "load": ["/src/assets/c4w7h6.len5.20240803.gamegraph.json", "/src/assets/c4w7h6.len5.20240803.bht.json"],
    "start_active_states_list": [],
    "draw_optimal_flag": true
}
```
