# Individual Interests, Projects, and Learnings Timeline

This is a good chance for me to clean up what I have been working on during the past years.

## May 2024 - Present: Personal Website III

I have been dreaming about making my own static website generator and learning full-stack web development in depth. Next.js was pretty good, but I do feel it's not ideal for constantly adding new gadgets and rendering Markdown files into static sites. Anyway, the summer break is a good opportunity for me to think about the underlying structures of my website, relationships between pages, and importation between JavaScript files. Knowing the origination and purpose of every byte of my website (as much as possible) is very rewarding. Currently, in my understanding, except those from the "three.js" library, all bytes sent to the client browser are by my design.

## May 2024 - Present: Visualizing Connect Four

Visualizing the Connect Four game graph.

## May 2024 - Present: Making a Barnes Hut Tree Rust crate

Learning to write and publish my first open-source project. The project is for accelerating the n-body force calculation for force-directed graph layout algorithm.

```graph
{
    "load": ["/src/assets/bht/Airfoil1.bht.test.json"],
    "camera_param": {
        "z": 2.0
    }
}
```

## Dec 2023 - Present: Solving Connect Four

I have reproduced and replicated the algorithm, ideas, and results of Pascal Pons' blog about solving Connect Four. I think this experience is indeed a very comprehensive summary of my previous learnings, including ideas from competitive programming and full-stack web development.

## Nov 2023 - Present: Graph Layout III

## Oct 2023 - Present: Learning "Competitive" Programming III

I started to learn a new programming language: Rust-lang.

## Oct 2023 - May 2024: Personal Website II

After I interacted with a few course websites, textbooks, and documentations rendered from markdown, especially the rust's official "mdbook" idea, I feel that is a good way for me to build my website, considering the composing experience and customizability.

## Aug 2023 - Sept 2023: Personal Website II

After I had learned Three.js and React.js and rewrote the graph layout project, I planned to build a new website to display my graph visualization results.

## May 2023 - Sept 2023: Graph Layout Restart II

Finally, I had time to rethink the types and algorithms of graph layout in C++.

## Feb 2023 - Apr 2023: Visualizing One Plus One Game Graph

## Dec 2022 - Jan 2023: Three.js Journey

Previously, I have interacted with the Three.js library for drawing 3D graphs. This time, I took time to systematically learn how to create 3D things on the web with Three.js and Blender, along with computer graphic knowledge.

## Oct 2022 - Nov 2022: Cognitive Games: Making Interactive Maze Games

## Aug 2022 - Oct 2023: Learning Competitive Programming in a Non-competitive way II

After I finished CS128 in the summer semester of 2022, I decided to continuously archive interesting competitive programming problems I have studied.

## Nov 2021 - 2022 Jun: Personal Website I

## Aug 2021 - 2022 Jun: Coursera Period

I have completed 20-ish Coursera courses, ranging from UIUC's Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals to web development, machine learning, and even a bit of game development.

## Nov 2019 - 2021 May: Graph Layout Visualization

I started to learn Yifan Hu's Mutli-level Force-directed graph layout algorithm in the hope of plotting graphs of game states in the future. At the time, I was learning to use Python to implement the algorithm. To create visualizations, I directly inserted codes to draw and store images during the visualization process. Thinking back now, that's indeed not a good choice, but these visualizations were very rewarding.

## Nov 2019 - Nov 2019: HIMCM Computational Part

## Sept 2019 - Dec 2019: Teaching Sorts and Recursions in Scratch

## May 2019 - Dec 2019: Yau-award competition

At that time, I was trying to replicate the results of a paper given by my instructor about non-line-of-sight imaging. While knowing nothing about matrices, I learned the idea that light reflections are somewhat similar to multiplying a matrix about the coefficients of energy loss at different angles. In the finale, as I can remember, one professor from Cal-Tech caught the problem about the potential inconsistency of the matrix. But that's still a very important experience to me regarding research and communicating with instructors and teammates. I'm glad that the professor caught the problems in our understanding.

## Jan 2019-Feb 2019: Visualizing Movie Box offices with Python and Pandas

## Sept 2018 - Present: Learning "Competitive" Programming Part I

## Sept 2018-Jan 2019: Visualizing Three-body with Python and Matplotlib

## Before 2018: Learning Recursion, Hanoi Tower, and Fractals with MIT's Scratch

I would say that I was attracted by the idea of recursion. Debugging recursive drawings is really interesting. One moment before, the lines were completely messed up, and with a change in a line, the lines were in the right position and forming beautiful geometric patterns. I still remember how a best friend pointed out that my calculation of imaginary numbers was missing a negative sign, and the whole problem was fixed with the negative sign in the correct position.

## Before 2018: Minecraft Command Blocks

I guess this experience was my first exposure to computational minds. I still remember how I created a skeleton archer riding a zombie who was skilled in both close-quarter combat and ranged attacks.
