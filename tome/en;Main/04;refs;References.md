This page lists some of my major references of my projects. I have read those papers in detail, to a reproducing-replicating level.

## Pascal Pons' Blogs about Solving Connect Four

Pascal Pons' blogs discusses how to use various of algorithms and optimization techniques to solve the game Connect Four. Pascal iteratively introduced the concepts from shallow to deep: from how to represent a Connect Four state in computer to how to use memorizations to accelerate the computing process.

I have reproduced, using the original code from the author, and replicated, writing my own code with the same idea, the results. I'm trying to learn a general sense of how the alpha-beta algorithm works. Â Sometimes, I feel that why the algorithm can return the lower bound without getting a valid result is slightly confusing. I'm trying to make visualizations about this to see the algorithm's behavior in detail.

## Yifan Hu's Paper: Efficient, High-Quality Force-Directed Graph Drawing

- Link: [yifanhu.net/PUB/graph_draw.pdf (Last Accessed: 2024-05-05)](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/graph_draw.pdf)

The author introduced the concepts of graph visualization, goals of graph visualization, naive force-directed graph layout, graph corsening and multi-level layout, and Barnes-Hut tree for N-body calculation acceleration.

I have replicated the result of the Multi-level Force-directed Graph Layout algorithm, including one of the graph coarsening algorithm, force-directed graph layout algorithm, and the Barnes-Hut tree N-body force calculation data structure. I have implemented these in Python around 2020, C++ arround 2023, and Rust (in progress).

## Victor Allis's paper about A Knowledge Based Approach of Connect Four

- APA: Allis, Louis Victor. "A Knowledge-Based Approach of Connect-Four." J. _Int. Comput. Games Assoc._ 11.4 (1988): 165

This is the paper I got confused about after it got into the knowledge-based part. But I feel it's getting clearer after I had my "demo"'s help. But with more experience in implementing the first-sight state game bound calculation. For example, if our opponent got two immediate winning positions in two different columns or one atop the one immediate one, we lose.
